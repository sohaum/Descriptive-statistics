# Statistics with Python

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover various topics related to descriptive statistics and probability distributions using Python.

## Notebooks

### 1. Compute Descriptive Statistics with Python
[Compute descriptive statistics with Python.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/Statistics/blob/main/Compute%20descriptive%20statistics%20with%20Python.ipynb)

In this notebook, we cover the following topics:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation
- Quartiles and Interquartile Range
- Skewness and Kurtosis
- Visualization techniques for descriptive statistics

### 2. Exemplar: Explore Descriptive Statistics
[Exemplar_Explore descriptive statistics.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/Statistics/blob/main/Exemplar_Explore%20descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

This notebook provides practical examples of exploratory data analysis (EDA) including:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Distribution Analysis
- Correlation and Covariance
- Identifying Outliers
- Visualizing Data with Seaborn and Matplotlib

### 3. Work with Probability Distributions in Python
[Work with probability distributions in Python.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/Statistics/blob/main/Work%20with%20probability%20distributions%20in%20Python.ipynb)

In this notebook, we delve into probability distributions, covering:
- Discrete Distributions (Binomial, Poisson)
- Continuous Distributions (Normal, Exponential)
- Probability Density Functions (PDFs)
- Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)
- Sampling Techniques

### 4. Sampling with Python
[Sampling with Python.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/Statistics/blob/main/Sampling%20with%20Python.ipynb)

- This repository provides a comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts aimed at performing statistical analysis and sampling.
- Demonstrates various sampling methods including random, stratified, clustered and systematic sampling (Probability Sampling).
